# Multiplication Table Generator: Docker Learning Project

This project demonstrates a simple web application consisting of two services: a FastAPI backend and a Streamlit frontend. It's designed to help you understand and revise core Docker and Docker Compose concepts by building and orchestrating a multi-service application.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The application is a "Fancy Multiplication Table Generator" with the following components:

* **FastAPI Backend (`main.py`):** A lightweight Python web API that receives a number and returns its multiplication table (up to 10) as JSON.

* **Streamlit Frontend (`app.py`):** A user-friendly web interface that allows users to input a number, sends this number to the FastAPI backend, and displays the generated multiplication table.

This setup is ideal for learning how different services can communicate and be managed within a containerized environment.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives (Docker Concepts)

This project is structured to help you grasp the following fundamental Docker concepts:

### 1. Dockerfiles: Blueprints for Images

* **What it is:** A text file that contains all the commands, in order, needed to build a Docker image. Each command creates a new layer in the image, promoting efficiency through caching.

* **Why we use two:** We have two distinct services (FastAPI and Streamlit), each requiring a different set of dependencies and entrypoint commands. Therefore, we create a `Dockerfile.fastapi` and a `Dockerfile.streamlit`.

* **Key Directives:**

    * `FROM python:3.13-slim-bullseye`: Specifies the base image. `slim-bullseye` is chosen for a smaller image size, containing only essential Python components.

    * `WORKDIR /app`: Sets the working directory inside the container. All subsequent commands (like `COPY` and `RUN`) will be executed relative to this directory.

    * `COPY ./table_generator/requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt`: Copies the `requirements.txt` file into the container. Doing this *before* copying the rest of the code allows Docker to cache the dependency installation layer. If only your code changes, Docker won't re-install dependencies.

    * `RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`: Executes a command during the image build process. `--no-cache-dir` reduces the image size by not storing pip's cache.

    * `COPY ./table_generator/main.py /app/main.py` (or `app.py`): Copies the actual application code into the container.

    * `EXPOSE 8000` (or `8501`): Informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime. This is documentation; it doesn't actually publish the port.

    * `CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]`: Defines the default command that will be executed when a container is launched from this image. `0.0.0.0` makes the service accessible from outside the container's localhost.

### 2. Docker Images: Portable Application Packages

* **What it is:** A lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.

* **How they are built:** From a `Dockerfile` using `docker build` or `docker compose build`.

* **Tagging:** Assigning a label (e.g., `latest`, `1.0.0`) to an image for versioning and easy identification.

    * `docker tag <local_image_name> <dockerhub_username>/<repo_name>:<tag>`

* **Pushing to Docker Hub:** Uploading your built images to a public (or private) registry like Docker Hub, making them shareable and pullable by others.

    * `docker push <dockerhub_username>/<repo_name>:<tag>`

### 3. Docker Containers: Running Instances of Images

* **What it is:** A runnable instance of a Docker image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI.

* **How they are run:** From an image using `docker run` or orchestrated by `docker compose up`.

### 4. Docker Compose: Orchestrating Multi-Service Applications

* **What it is:** A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file (`docker-compose.yml`) to configure the application's services.

* **Why it's used here:** To define and manage both the FastAPI backend and Streamlit frontend as a single application, handling their networking, dependencies, and port mappings.

* **Key Directives in `docker-compose.yml`:**

    * `version: '3.8'`: Specifies the Docker Compose file format version.

    * `services`: Defines the individual applications or components that make up your overall application.

        * `fastapi_backend`: The name of your FastAPI service. This name is used for internal DNS resolution within the Docker network.

        * `streamlit_frontend`: The name of your Streamlit service.

    * `build`: Instructs Docker Compose to build an image from a `Dockerfile` for this service.

        * `context: .`: Specifies the build context (the directory where Docker looks for files). `.` means the current directory (`my_multi_app`).

        * `dockerfile: Dockerfile.fastapi`: Points to the specific Dockerfile to use.

    * `image: <dockerhub_username>/<repo_name>:<tag>`: (Alternative to `build`) Specifies a pre-built image to pull from a registry (like Docker Hub) instead of building it locally. This is used for deployment.

    * `ports: - "8000:8000"`: Maps a port on the host machine (left side) to a port inside the container (right side). This allows you to access the services from your browser.

    * `networks: - app_network`: Connects the service to a custom Docker network.

    * `environment: FASTAPI_URL: http://fastapi_backend:8000`: Sets environment variables inside the container. Crucially, `fastapi_backend` is used here because it's the service name within the Docker network, allowing the frontend to resolve the backend's address.

    * `depends_on: - fastapi_backend`: Ensures that the `fastapi_backend` service starts and is healthy before the `streamlit_frontend` service attempts to start.

### 5. Docker Networks: Enabling Inter-Container Communication

* **What it is:** A virtual network created by Docker that allows containers to communicate with each other in an isolated environment.

* **Why it's used:** By putting both `fastapi_backend` and `streamlit_frontend` on the same `app_network`, they can communicate using their service names (e.g., `http://fastapi_backend:8000`) instead of relying on host IP addresses.

* `driver: bridge`: The default network driver, which creates a private internal network for containers on the same host.
